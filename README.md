# Internship-Work-M1
The main objective of the internship is to create Knowledge Graphs (KG) that describes the IT’m Factory, such that a remote agent-based control system 
can observe the real time state of the factory and acts on it in a unified manner. In addition to the directly stated knowledge, Knowledge Graphs also 
include logical rules to derive indirect knowledge, which makes them a suitable extraction to represent factory lines in Industry 4.0 scenarios. 
Industrial equipment, sensors and actuators are represented as entities that are related to each other via spatial and structural relationships in terms
of system engineering. The existing KG for the IT’m factory already includes these entities, but it is not sufficient for industrial control. Specifically, 
it does not contain interdependencies between the different properties of the overall production system. So, the main objective of the internship
is to create the KG, such that the full state of the system can be obtained from an evaluation of its observable properties on the overall machines.
